=== About WePing ===

WePing provides a simple user interface to post status messages to various
services using the ping.fm API.

What makes it useful is that it allows you to setup multiple users which then
will all use the same ping.fm account and thus will post to all the services
configured there - but without knowing either your ping.fm password nor the
various passwords for your social sites.

For example you could use this to let your marketing department people post
to your company's twitter and facebook pages without giving them access to
these accounts.

=== Setting up WePing ===

Just unpack the package on a PHP cabable webserver, copy the config.sample.php
to config.php and configure your ping.fm APP key and your users

If Digest Auth isn't working for you, you need to pass through the needed
authorization headers to PHP. There is an example .htaccess file with several
methods to do so included in this package.
